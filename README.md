# Video-processing-with-screen-time-calculation
In this project, we can calculate the screen time of each character appearing in a video. 

Firstly, we convert the video into images and using mapping.csv, we specify the character classes.
In this video there are 2 charecters, tom and jerry. so, there will be three classes(0,1,2) 

implemented using deep learning (VGG16) neural network. 

The neural network model has achieved an accuracy of 99.5192289352417

It is implemented using python in jupyter notebook.
